Transparent on-screen keyboard.

Layouts are completely customizable. You can easily change key size, position, 
background. It's very easy to add international characters and new layouts. 
Just have a look at /opt/qtmoko/etc/im/svgkbd/ The layouts are normal svg 
images. You can use inkscape to open and edit them. It should be very clear 
what to do. Only thing to explain is how you should name the key XML elements. 
In Inkscape go to Edit->XML editor and click on key. The element name must be 
in form:

        key_QtKeycode_unicode

For possible QtKeycode values check this link[4] and for unicode values use 
your favourite unicode character map.

Please not that my layouts are just very simple. If you manage to create 
better ones i will be glad to replace them. I can also make your national 
keyboards variants easily installable from qtmoko apps page.
